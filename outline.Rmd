1. Reproducible and replicable
    - **Reproducible**: Runs on other people's computers
    - Replicable: Repeating a study gives similar conclusions

2. Why is running on other people's computers important?
    - coworkers, collaborators, peer review
    - validation, verification, replication
    - different computers for development and analysis
    - your future self

3. Components of reproducibility
    - hardware
    - software: OS version, R version and packages
    - **data**: directory paths
    - **workflow**: what to run how and when

4. Describing data and workflow
    - the simpler the description, the more likely successful
    - ideally, a single script that runs everything
      - open data: download/harvest from web
      - restricted data: operate directly on raw data
      - avoid "manual cleaning"
      - model estimation, analysis, ..., final report
