# Reproducible

### vs.

# Replicable

???

- **Reproducible**: Can obtain same results from same data
- Replicable: Repeating a study gives similar conclusions

# Why?

???

Why is running on other people's computers important?

- coworkers, collaborators, peer review
- validation, verification, replication
- different computers for development and analysis
- your future self

# Other people's computers

- hardware
- software: OS version, R version and packages
    - virtualization
    - `packrat`
- data: directory paths
    - open data
    - `here`
- **workflow**: what to run how and when

Components of reproducibility
- hardware

# A recipe

???

- the simpler the description, the more likely successful
- ideally, a single script that runs everything
    - open data: download/harvest from web
    - restricted data: operate directly on raw data
    - avoid "manual cleaning"
    - model estimation, analysis, ..., final report

- complete instructions to prepare the meal
- works for humans
- works for computers
- **does not** work well for learning or modifying
