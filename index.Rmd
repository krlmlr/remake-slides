# Reproducible

### vs.

# Replicable

???

Thank you.  First of all, I'd like to do a small survey, to make sure we're on the same page.  Who has already been

- programmed?
- programmed in R?
- written a function in R?
- installed software?
- compiled software?
- used Make?
- used remake?

Great!  This presentation focuses on the last two points,
I hope this presentation will be useful to you.

I'd like to start with definitions.  What is a "reproducible workflow"?
In the context of research, we must differentiate between "reproducible" and "replicable".

- **Reproducible**: Can obtain same results from same data
- Replicable: Repeating a study gives similar conclusions

# Why?

???

Why is running on other people's computers important?

- coworkers, collaborators, peer review
- validation, verification, replication
- different computers for development and analysis
- your future self

# Other people's computers

- hardware
- software: OS version, R version and packages
    - virtualization
    - [`packrat`](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)
- data: directory paths
    - open data
    - [`here`](https://github.com/krlmlr/here)
- **workflow**: what to do how and when

???

Components of reproducibility
- hardware
- software: OS version, R version and packages
- data: directory paths
- **workflow**: what to run how and when


Describe the process with a simple example:
preparing a report that contains modeling results obtained from raw data.

Cooking a ragout from a piece of raw meat.

Vegetarians, please think of a substitute for the meat.

# Manuals

???

This is what XKCD has to say about manuals, I think this applies to workflow descriptions as well.

- the simpler the description, the more likely successful
    - open data: download/harvest from web
    - restricted data: operate directly on raw data
    - cleanup scripts, avoid "manual cleaning"
    - model estimation, analysis, ..., final report

- ideally, a single script that runs everything
    - of course, you're doing this already

- unstructured description?

# A recipe

???

- complete instructions to prepare the meal
- works for humans
- works for computers
- **does not** work well for
    - modification
    - extension
    - learning

# Splitting the recipe

???

- describe as a set of transformations
- each step has inputs, outputs, and uses a **transformation rule**
- the inputs and outputs are called **targets**
- vegetables?

- arbitrary complexity if the dependency structure doesn't contain cycles

- define process as a directed acyclic graph
- rule-based tools
